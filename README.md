# Pop!_OS fresh install

This script just makes it easier to install software after a fresh install of the OS.

This is a work in progress, but the script is designed to run multiple times without adverse effects.

# TODO

Looks like now I need a list to keep track of everything I want to do/fix:

- [ ] Add a Changelog
- [X] ~~Fix location of Go installation file~~
- [ ] Fix/add Epic Games (via Legendary) things (currently it's kind of incomplete)
